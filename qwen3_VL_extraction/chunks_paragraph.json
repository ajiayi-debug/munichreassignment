The science of health as applied in recent years reveals wonderful progress in the avoidance of disease, and in the control of the violent epidemics by which in the past nations were almost exterminated. Modern methods of hygiene and sanitation as applied to public health have robbed smallpox and diphtheria of their death-dealing power; cholera and yellow fever have been forced to retreat before the victorious hosts of applied medical science; tuberculosis, the greatest foe of human life, is slowly but surely receding before the determined efforts of modern preventive medicine.\n\nBy nature man is endowed with resistive power sufficient to ward off most forms of disease, provided he keeps his health at a normal standard by right living. If, however, he allows his health to become impaired by reason of overwork, bad habits, wilful exposure to contagion or unhealthful surroundings, he readily falls a prey to disease.\n\nThe author of *Principles of Public Health* has here set forth the general rules of life by the observance of which every adult and every child not only can do much to preserve his own health but also can prove himself a prominent factor in raising the standard of public health. A campaign of education is demanded to arrest the enormous loss of life which is carrying so many to untimely graves, and the instruction given in this volume will be of inestimable value in teaching people how to avoid avoidable disease.",

How often we hear a child say, \"When I am a man,\" or \"When I am a woman;\" but I have never heard a boy or a girl say, \"If I live to be a man or woman.\" When you think of what you will do when you are grown into men or women, it never occurs to you that you may be weak and sickly and therefore not able to do the very things that you would most like to do. This suggests that sickness is not natural, else the thought that you may perhaps become sick would enter your mind. As a matter of fact, most sickness is not natural.\n\nThere is a constant struggle going on in the world. You see a fight about you every day among the animals.

The body is made of bones and muscles, covered with skin, and all these are made up of very fine particles that we call cells. Every part of the body is made of these fine cells. The cells are so small that they can be seen only with a powerful microscope. If you look at your hand you cannot see a cell, because it takes a great many cells to make a spot large enough for you to see. In Figure 1 you see a boy looking through a microscope, and beside him you see a picture of what he sees. This picture does not look like the skin on your hand, neither does it look like the skin on the boy's hand; but it is nothing more nor less than a piece of skin taken from that boy's hand, and it looks just as a piece of skin from your own hand would look if you were to see it through a very strong microscope.\n\nThe whole body is made up of just such little cells as you see in Figure 4, and each cell is alive and has a certain work to perform.

Cells can be killed by too much heat or too much cold. When you skin your hand, you kill many cells, and at the same time make an opening for germs to get in and cause sickness. You can kill cells also by starving them, for they must have not only enough food, but the right kind of food. If you feed your bodies on nothing but candy, pie, and cake, most of the cells will refuse to perform their work and many of them will die. These cells must have also an abundance of air, and the air must be pure and fresh. If you breathe the air that others have breathed or that contains poison of any kind, you will soon find that you are not feeling well. This simply means that so many of the cells are being starved for fresh air, that not enough strong ones are left to do the necessary work. You can kill these cells by overwork, for they must have a proper amount of rest. If you go to school all day long and then sit up until midnight every night, you must not expect the cells of your body to keep strong and well. You can kill these cells by the use of certain things that act as poisons to them, such as tobacco, beer, wine, or whisky.\n\nQuestions. 1. In what way is the body like an automobile? 2.

If you take off your coat after you are too warm, your body becomes chilled. Baseball pitchers know this, and if you watch a good pitcher, you will see that he always puts on his sweater as soon as he stops pitching, even though he is very warm. He knows that if he cools off too quickly, he will become stiff and sore and cannot pitch good ball.\n\nSometimes a person sits in a warm room until he begins to perspire freely. Then he opens a window and sits in the draft. Under ordinary conditions, the cool wind alone would chill the body, but now the rapid drying of the perspiration makes the body cool still more quickly. The sudden chill causes the person to take cold, which is simply another way of saying that he has killed many cells and caused others to fall sick, so that they cannot perform their work. We cannot get too much fresh air. Drafts do not hurt us if we are thoroughly wrapped up; but it is very dangerous to allow the wind to strike the body when it is not well protected, and especially when it is damp with perspiration.\n\nDamp clothing chills the body very rapidly and kills many cells.

Therefore it is necessary to have food that makes heat in the body, in addition to food that builds cells.\n\nWe eat a great many kinds of foods, and all that we eat is used either for building new cells or for producing heat in the body. Thus we can divide all our foods into two classes—building material and heat-producing material. The type of building material is lean meat, and the type of heat-producing material is fat meat and starches, such as potatoes and bread. Milk contains much building material as well as heat-producing material. That is why a baby grows and keeps warm while he takes nothing but milk.\n\nLean meat is the best of all building foods. Eggs are largely a form of lean meat, and hence constitute a good article of food for building purposes.

But the boy or girl who tries to become a strong man or woman by eating only vegetables will be disappointed; these are mostly heat-producing foods and will not make strong bodies. Experience has proved that the best results are obtained by eating what is called \"a mixed diet,\" that is, a diet composed partly of lean meats and partly of fats and vegetables.\n\nOf the heat-producing foods, fat is the most powerful. Most of the fat that we eat is used immediately for producing in the body heat, and therefore power, but a part of it is stored up for future use. We see it in all healthy young persons. It is this stored-up fat that gives the body its rounded form.

As the fat is not digested until it comes to the intestines, the saliva never reaches the coverings of the starch, and more work is thrown on the other juices of the body. The result is that the little glands which make these other juices are overworked, or else the starch is not digested at all and therefore furnishes no nourishment to the body. When bread is sticky (we sometimes call it soggy) in the middle of the loaf, it is because the flour has not been thoroughly cooked and the little grains or granules of starch are still hard.

In our mouths there is a fluid called saliva. Think of something that you are very fond of eating, and the mere thought of it makes the saliva come into your mouth. This saliva has a very important duty to perform in connection with preparing the food for the little cells of the body. Each little grain of starch—and you will remember that all vegetable foods are composed largely of starch—has a capsule about it. This simply means that it is done up in a little package. The saliva helps to open this capsule by making it soft (just as water will soften the paper on a package of candy), so that the other digestive juices can reach the starch and turn it into the kind of sugar that is used in the body. If you do not chew your food very fine, the saliva will not reach the starch granules, the little packages of starch will be hard to open when they go into the stomach, and much of the starch will never be made use of in the body. The saliva has much the same action on the coverings of the little packages of meat, for all the meat that we eat is done up in similar packages.\n\nA great Englishman, Mr. Gladstone, who lived to be eighty-three, made a practice of chewing every bite of food twenty times, and he thought this had a great deal to do with his being such a strong and well man and living to such an old age.",

The air that goes into our lungs, if it is fresh and pure, contains a great deal of oxygen and a very little of another gas called carbon dioxide. The air that comes out of the lungs contains a very little oxygen and a great deal of carbon dioxide. The blood not only takes the oxygen out of the air, but gives carbon dioxide to the air.

It takes a great deal of fresh air to supply the body with oxygen—about 1,250 cubic feet of air each hour. With thirty or forty children in a room, it does not take long to use up all the oxygen.

Your stomach does work that is even more important to you than cooking.\n\nIt takes about four hours for your stomach to dispose of what you give it at a single meal. If you eat your breakfast at eight o'clock, your stomach is going to be kept busy to get rid of it by noon. Of course you expect to give it more work to do at noon; that is, you expect to eat a good luncheon. It will be after four o'clock by the time your stomach has finished the task you put on it at noon, and there will be only about an hour and a half for the stomach to rest before you will be ready to give it another four hours' task, digesting your supper. This means that your stomach cannot go to sleep until ten o'clock. If you eat three meals a day, you will give your stomach just about two hours' rest between eight in the morning and ten at night. If you let it rest from ten at night until eight in the morning, it is not likely to give you any trouble.\n\nSome people will not let their stomachs rest at all. Often boys and girls give their stomachs extra work to do by eating sweetmeats in the middle of the morning while their stomachs are still busy with breakfast. Then, as soon as school is out in the afternoon, they want to eat more cake and candy, and thus take away from the stomach the little rest it has a right to expect before it goes to work on supper. Then suppose they go to a party and eat again about midnight. How much time will the stomach have to rest before breakfast?",

This is due to the fact that the eyeball is too long, so that the lens does not cause the rays of light to focus on the retina. Some people are called far-sighted. This means that they can see well at a distance, but that it is hard for them to see things close to them. Far-sighted children can usually see things near by, but they do this by making the muscle that rules the lens of the eye work too hard.\n\nProbably your teacher has a test chart and can tell you whether your eyes are properly focused.

It is the lack of red blood cells that causes the cigarette smoker to look pale and sallow.\n\nIt is probably not the direct effect of tobacco that causes the loss of red blood cells, but something that is connected with the act of smoking. When you take smoke into your mouth, you take in at the same time a gas known as carbon monoxid. This gas is very poisonous to the body, and combines with the red blood cells in such a way that they cannot take up the oxygen in the lungs and carry it to the rest of the cells in the body. The cigarette smoker almost always inhales the smoke, and thus he absorbs a great deal more of the carbon monoxid than the man who does not inhale the smoke.

People who use much tobacco have what they call \"palpitation of the heart,\" but doctors call it \"tobacco heart,\" because it is caused by the use of tobacco. No insurance company will insure a person who has \"tobacco heart.\"\n\nMost boys grow up to be men before they manage to use enough tobacco to cause tobacco heart.

However, long before they are grown, they show that the tobacco has affected their hearts, because they are short of breath and stand about as much chance of winning a race as does a mouth-breather.\n\nThe effect of alcohol is a subject on which I want to speak very plainly and frankly, because I do not want the boys and girls who read this to get the same idea that I got when I was in school, or to be affected by it as I was. When I was a little boy I was taught that if a person drank alcohol in any form the lining of his stomach would be eaten up. In proof of this statement I was shown a picture of an ulcerated stomach that was said to have resulted from drinking whisky. Naturally I expected to find that people who drank whisky would not be able to eat anything at all, or would be troubled a great deal with pain in their stomachs. To my surprise, I found that many people had ulcers of the stomach who never took an alcoholic drink, while many of those who drank a great deal seemed to have the best of appetites and were never troubled with their stomachs. As a result, I came to the conclusion that all this talk about the evil effects of alcohol was foolishness. Later I studied medicine, and learned that the effect of alcohol on the stomach is, in reality, the least of its evils. But I want to impress upon you that, as a result of forty years' study, I consider alcohol the most dangerous thing in the world to-day. By \"alcohol\" we mean any drink that contains alcohol, such as whisky, wine, brandy, beer, etc.\n\n(3) On the nervous system",

It might seem that this would aid digestion in the stomach, but it does not, because alcohol affects the food in the stomach in such a way that it prevents the gastric juice from acting on the food. If the use of alcohol is persisted in, it causes the little cells in the stomach that make the gastric juice to become filled with fat, and then those cells cannot make the gastric juice. Thus, continued use of alcohol causes a smaller supply of gastric juice, and the food passes from the stomach into the intestines without having been acted upon by the gastric juice, as it should have been. The result is that the food decomposes in the intestines and a poison is formed. This poison is taken up by the vessels that carry the food from the intestines and kills a great many of the cells of the body.\n\nAlcohol does not burn holes in the stomach, but it destroys the usefulness of the stomach by its action on the cells that secrete the gastric juice.\n\nWhen alcohol is taken into the stomach, very little of it reaches the intestines. It is rapidly absorbed by the lining of the stomach and passes into the blood. The blood from the stomach goes directly to the liver. The alcohol makes the cells of the liver hard and causes them to become filled with fat, as it does the cells of the stomach. In this way it destroys the action of these cells and prevents their doing the work for which they are intended. From the liver the alcohol goes with the blood to all parts of the body, and it has its influence on all the cells in the body. This influence is always harmful.",

This shows that the use of alcohol reduces our resisting powers, and puts our cells in such condition that we cannot overcome the effects of disease.\n\nPeople who are sick with a slow disease like consumption are often advised by their friends to take whisky to brace them up. It is true that the immediate effect of the whisky is to make the patient feel a little better, but the final effect is to leave him in a much weaker condition than before. More than this, the cells are much less able to resist the disease germs than they were before the alcohol was taken.

We know that certain diseases are communicable (catching), but it has not yet been determined whether some others are communicable or not.

Only a few years ago it was believed that one could not take consumption from another person, but now we know that this is the very way to get it.

Did you ever think how many people handle an apple? First, the man who picks it from the tree; then the examiner in the packing house where apples are taken to see that they are the right kind to be packed in a certain box. Then it is wiped off by a boy or girl—handling number three; then it is wrapped in paper—number four. Next it is packed in a box, but in this case the paper protects the apple from dirty hands. When the merchant buys the apples he feels several of them, and puts them out on the display shelf; this makes handling number five. Everyone who thinks of buying apples will touch one or more of them, and when they are sold the clerk handles them again. In other words, every apple goes through the hands of at least seven people before you get it. Do you not think it needs washing?\n\nGo into a butcher shop and see how many people will put their dirty fingers on the meat. Some of them even keep their gloves on when they do this.

If we could dispose of the manure, there would be one place less for the fly to lay her eggs. Behind barns we usually find piles of manure. It is in these heaps that the fly lays her eggs, not in the little lumps found in the streets. Now, there is no sense in keeping this great pile of manure about any barn. In towns the manure can be put into a box with a cover, so that the flies cannot get at it. In the country every well-managed farm has the barns cleaned out every day, and it would not be much more trouble for the farmer to throw the manure into a wagon and take it to the fields with him, than it is to pile it up beside his barn. If he did this, he would find that there would be few flies about his house.\n\n(1) By removal of manure",

Because the well is too close to an out-house or some other source of filth. When a man in the country or in a small town builds a house, he immediately thinks of digging a well just as close to the house as he can, so that he need not carry the water far. Next he thinks of locating the closet, and this, too, he wants near the house. The well and the closet are often near each other, and often the closet is on higher ground than the well. The vault under the closet is seldom water-tight. In fact, the intention of the owner is that a great part of the vault contents shall soak away.\n\nIn many localities the ground is an open gravel, and the vault contents run through this gravel into the well, carrying disease germs with them. In one little town, with wells as a source of drinking water, the health officers found that the closet of every house was draining directly into its well.

The person in whose throat the germs are will have no idea that they are there, but when he comes in contact with some one who has a delicate throat, he may give diphtheria to that person. The disease does not develop in some throats because the body cells are all healthy and doing their work so well that, when the diphtheria germs try to take hold, they are driven off and not allowed to grow.

Only two things are necessary for getting rid of diphtheria: one is to quarantine every case, and the other, to have the people do just what they are told when under quarantine. This latter is just as important as the quarantine itself, for people often do not obey the health officer's directions. Now let us see what are some of these directions.\n\nIf you are the patient, the health officer will say that you must be put in a room where there is just enough furniture to make you comfortable, and that no one except the nurse and the doctor is to go into that room. He will say that the nurse must stay in your room all the time, or that she must at least not go into any other room in the house; that your meals must be left outside your door, and that the person who brings them must go away before the door is opened by the nurse.

This substance we call *antitoxin*, which means opposed to the toxin in the blood. If the little cells make the substance fast enough, the germs will stop growing, or in some cases they never really get started growing, because they cannot exist where there is much antitoxin. Antitoxin looks like clear water. The following experiment will show you something that acts in very much the same way that antitoxin does.\n\nHow diphtheria toxin is fought",

[3] Lemon juice is acid, and is just the opposite of alkali. Now, if you put a few drops of ammonia, which is alkali, into the red solution, it will turn blue again. If you put a little more lemon juice, very carefully, drop by drop, into the blue solution, it will gradually turn lighter, until it is entirely clear.\n\nWe will suppose that the blue is due to the toxin produced by the diphtheria germ, and that the lemon juice is the antitoxin produced by the cells in the body. If the antitoxin is made fast enough, the blue disappears; but if the toxin is made faster than the antitoxin, the blue remains. It is the same way in the body, only it is not litmus and acids and alkalis that we have to deal with. If the toxin is made faster than the antitoxin, the germs grow, and we get sicker and sicker; but if the antitoxin is made faster than the toxin, then the germs cannot grow, and we soon get well, or perhaps do not get sick at all.",

One day a doctor suggested, \"If we cannot find out the chemical nature of this thing that is made in the body, why can we not make it in the body of some animal and then use the blood of the animal?\" And that is just what they did. They put diphtheria germs into beef tea, and let them grow very fast and make all the toxin they could. Then the doctors strained the germs out by passing the beef tea through a fine filter, in this way getting the poison, and not the germs. Then they gave a strong, healthy horse a small quantity of this poison; they did not feed it to him, but injected it into his blood. Of course the horse was sick for a while, but soon he began to get well again, for the cells in his body immediately went to work making antitoxin.\n\nHow antitoxin was discovered",

Then the doctors said, \"His blood is full of antitoxin, and we will see what it will do when injected into some other animal.\" So they drew off some of the horse's blood and took out all the little red cells, leaving nothing but the clear fluid of the blood. They planted diphtheria germs in a rabbit's throat, and when the rabbit became very sick, they gave him some of the antitoxin from the horse. The rabbit immediately got well. Afterward they gave some of this antitoxin to a little boy who was very sick with diphtheria, and he, too, got well. Ever since then the doctors have been saving many lives by the use of antitoxin.",

More than this, we know that when the antitoxin is given within the first twenty-four hours after the patient is taken sick, there is only about one death for every one thousand cases of diphtheria. Do you not think that this is strong proof that antitoxin saves lives?\n\nAntitoxin saves lives not only by curing those who have diphtheria, but by preventing others from having it. If a person who has been where there is a case of diphtheria is given a dose of antitoxin, he will not have the disease, because his blood will contain enough antitoxin to destroy the diphtheria toxin present. If you will watch a careful doctor when he makes his first visit to a case of diphtheria, you will notice that, as soon as he gets through treating the patient, he gives all members of the family who have been near the patient a dose of antitoxin to keep them from getting sick.\n\nSome people may tell you that antitoxin is a poison and should not be used. The statement that it is in itself a poison is true. But it is also true that in your body there are many things that would poison you if you got too much of them. For instance, there is a gland in your throat (the thyroid) which secretes a substance that is necessary for your health, but if you were to take the secretion of ten such glands it would kill you at once. Now, if the cells in your body make antitoxin when you have diphtheria, it is probable that antitoxin is the very thing needed. And if you can help these cells by giving them antitoxin, ready-made, does it not seem a reasonable thing to do? People who give the name of poison to a substance which is known to have saved many lives are not worthy of attention.

We do know that they are transferred from one person to another; but not being able to locate the cause, as we can in the diseases of which we do know the germ, we cannot explain how it is done.\n\nAmong the diseases of this class we find scarlet fever. In one respect scarlet fever acts much the same as diphtheria. A person may have it and not be very sick, sometimes hardly sick at all. At night a child may have a high fever, with a slightly sore throat, and the next morning he may feel perfectly well. The mother supposes that the fever was due to an \"upset stomach,\" thinks no more about it, and sends the child to school. The next time the child takes a bath, he perhaps notices that the skin peels off over some parts of the body. This means that the high fever was due to scarlet fever, but the breaking-out (rash) was so fine that it was not noticed. It also means that all the children in the school have been exposed to the disease. These very mild cases are the most dangerous because so often they are not recognized.",

These very mild cases are the most dangerous because so often they are not recognized.\n\nThere are two things to be remembered in connection with these mild forms of scarlet fever, as well as of every other communicable disease. The first is that the same cause which produces a mild form of the disease in one child may produce its most severe form in another child. You can contract a mild form of the disease from exposure to a severe case; and you can contract a severe form from exposure to a mild case. The character of the case to which you are exposed will give no indication of the form the disease will assume in your body.\n\nThe next thing to be remembered about the mild form of scarlet fever is that, though the child may not be made very sick at the time, there may later be very bad results. A child who has had scarlet fever in such a mild form that he hardly knew he was sick, may, for a while, appear to be quite well; then suddenly he has an earache, and an abscess forms. This abscess is due to the scarlet fever germs which have gone from the throat to the ear, and as a result the child may lose his hearing entirely.",

He does not care for his meals, does not care to play, says he is tired, and wants to lie still all the time. Finally his mother thinks it might be a good idea to have a doctor see him. The doctor examines his body carefully, and then asks for a sample of his urine. When he has examined this, he looks very serious and asks the mother when the child was sick last, and what the disease was. Perhaps she has forgotten all about the slight attack of fever, and the doctor must question her very carefully before she recalls it. At length it occurs to her, and then the doctor asks, \"After this attack of fever, did you notice that the skin came off his hands and body?\" She replies that she did, and then the doctor tells her that the child really had scarlet fever, and, owing to lack of care, he now has kidney disease. This is a very serious trouble, from which he may never recover, or, in case of recovery, he may always be weak and sickly. Even a mild attack of scarlet fever is not to be neglected; it is a severe and dangerous disease in its very mildest form. It not only kills a great many boys and girls, but it makes delicate in health for all their lives many of those who apparently recover.\n\nWe often hear people speak of two diseases which they think are not scarlet fever.

In the latter part of the eighteenth century Dr. Edward Jenner, an English physician, noticed that milkmaids did not have smallpox as much as did people of other occupations. He also noticed cows with little sores on their udders that looked very much like the sores that come with smallpox. He therefore tried making on the arms of people sores just like those on the udders of the cows. He did this by taking a little of the matter from the sores on the cows and putting it into the scratches on the people's arms. After these sores had healed, the people who had been thus treated did not have smallpox. This simple practice has caused one of the most deadly diseases known to man to become one of the most easily controlled.\n\nThough it is well known that before the discovery of vaccination smallpox was a fatal disease, there are still some persons who say that vaccination has done nothing to reduce the mortality.

We want to get in just enough to make the cells work, and no more. Therefore we make a very small scratch, and put into it some of the vaccine which contains the toxin of smallpox. It is impossible to have these germs in your body and not be affected by them to some degree. If you did not feel a little sick, the cells would not be making antitoxin, for the thing that makes you sick is what makes the cells go to work.

From 1902 to 1903 the house was occupied by another father and mother with eight children. They moved away because of the great amount of sickness in the family. At present this father and one of his children have tuberculosis. In 1904 the house was occupied by still another family, consisting likewise of a father, mother, and eight children. Now it is known that four of the children have tuberculosis, and it is feared that three others have also contracted the disease. In 1905 a son of the first occupant, with his wife and two children, returned to live in the house. The father of this family died of tuberculosis. Up to 1906 the total results from this house, scattered through four families, were as follows: five deaths, six cases in people still living, and three suspected cases.\n\nWhen the consumptive coughs, he sends fine droplets of moisture into the air. These droplets contain the germs that cause tuberculosis. The moisture evaporates and the germs are left sticking to the floors, the walls, the curtains, and the furniture of the room.

The bones of the body are divided into four classes—long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones.\n\nRegardless of their shape, all bones are composed in the same way. Every bone has an outer and an inner portion. The outer portion is a dense layer called *compact bone*. The inner portion is more open, and is much weaker; this is called *cancellated bone* (from *cancella*, a sponge). In the smaller bones, the marrow, which is quite soft, runs through the spongy bone; in the larger long bones, the marrow is distinct and is enclosed by the spongy bone.",

In the smaller bones, the marrow, which is quite soft, runs through the spongy bone; in the larger long bones, the marrow is distinct and is enclosed by the spongy bone.\n\nEvery bone is covered by a thick, tough layer, the *periosteum*, which has three uses. When the bone is injured by disease or accident, the periosteum makes new bone to fill in and repair the break. It also builds new bone on the surface of the old as long as the body is growing. Finally, the periosteum gives strong and firm attachment to the muscles, which send tendons into it.\n\nEvery bone in the body (except the hyoid bone, to which the tongue is attached) is joined with some other bone. Most of them join with two or more bones. In most instances the end of a bone which joins with another is rounded off and made very smooth, so that it can slide easily over the other bone.

At the same time they have been putting something into the blood.

As these blood vessels grow larger the walls do not become so thick as the walls of the arteries of the same size. These larger vessels formed by the union of capillaries are called veins. In other words, the veins are simply continuations of the arteries that have divided into extremely small branches and have now come together again. The blood which has been changed is now called venous blood. It has much less oxygen in it, but has received a great deal of carbon dioxide.

Thus the nasal passage serves to warm, to moisten, and to clean the air we breathe, and is a very important part of the respiratory system, since either cold or dry air is very irritating to the lungs.\n\nFig. 84. The air passages of the head and throat.\n\nThere is only one tube leading from the back of the nasal passage to the lungs. Different parts of this tube are given different names. The pharynx is that part that extends from the back of the nose to the vocal chords. The larynx is the part of the throat where the vocal chords are located. We sometimes call it the \"Adam's apple.\" It is very prominent in some men, but seldom noticeable in women. The trachea is the part of the tube leading down from the larynx.

Each lobe is divided into lobules, which means small lobes. Each lobule is divided into air spaces, or cells, the work of the lungs is performed.\n\nThe capillaries run in the thin walls of the air spaces. The walls of these fine blood vessels are so very thin that the air in the air cells comes in almost direct contact with the blood in the vessels. While the blood is passing through the vessels in the walls of the air spaces, something happens to both the blood and the air. The air we take into our lungs contains a great deal of oxygen and very little carbon dioxide. The air that comes out of our lungs contains a great deal of carbon dioxide and much less oxygen. In other words, the oxygen from the air goes into the blood, and the carbon dioxide from the blood goes out into the air.\n\nIf the air we breathe is not pure and does not contain enough oxygen, the blood cannot get all the oxygen we need, and the cells of the body become sick and die. If, when we breathe, we do not fill each little air cell in our lungs with air, a great deal of the blood sent to the lungs for oxygen cannot get it. If we wear very tight clothing we cannot take a full breath and hence cannot fill all the air spaces with air. If the air spaces in the lungs are not filled, the blood does not get the oxygen it needs, as there is no other place in the body to get it.",

When you focus your eye you cannot move the back of the eye, but you can make the lens more or less convex as may be needed to make a clear picture.\n\nBehind the iris and the lens, we find the posterior chamber of the eye.

Even a whole chapter may be assigned to be studied with a view of answering in writing the questions at the end of the chapter. The written test can then take the place of the usual oral recitation. This method is suggested to the teacher who hesitates to discuss orally certain plain but essential facts.\n\nChapter 32 on the Spread and Prevention of Consumption can be treated with best results orally, if the pupils are first made to *feel* the great danger of consumption and to realize the possibility of preventing the vast havoc wrought by that dread disease.

Some prefer to have a strong, water-tight box placed under the closet seats. When this box is nearly full, it can be removed to some place where fertilizer is needed, and there emptied, the contents being plowed into the ground. In order to make this task as simple as possible, it is a good plan to put the box on skids, and have a heavy strip in one end with a bolt and ring through it, so that a horse can be hitched to the box to draw it away. If a little dry earth or lime is put into the box each day, there will be no unpleasant odor.\n\nThe teacher should demonstrate the action of acids and alkalis on a solution of litmus.",
