Modern methods of hygiene public health have robbed smallpox and diphtheria of and sanitation as t0 applied death-dealing power: cholera and yellow fever have been forced to retreat their before the victorious hosts of applied medical science; tuberculosis; the greatest foe of human life, is slowly but surely receding before the determined efforts of modern preventive medicine. By nature man is endowed with resistive sufficient t0 ward off most power forms of disease, provided he keeps his health at a normal standard by right living: If, however; he allows his health to become impaired by reason of overwork; bad habits, wilful exposure t0 contagion Or unhealthful surroundings, he readily falls a prey to disease. The author of Principles of Public Health has here set forth the general rules of life by the observance 0f which every adult and every child not only can do much to preserve his own health but also can prove himself a prominent factor in raising the standard of public health; A campaign of education is demanded t0 arrest the which is carrying so many t0 untimely graves; and the enormous loss of life instruction given in this volume will be of inestimable value in teaching people how t0 avoid avoidable disease. The author has not attempted to deal with all the diseases that may be classed as work is intended for use in the publie schools; only such preventable; as the fitting to present to school children: To teach diseases are mentioned as it seems our children a proper respect for their Own health and for the community welfare is to fit them for the best citizenship.

Starchy foods should be thoroughly cooked in order that the coverings which Why starchy surround the little granules may be broken Or made sofi: If starchy foods are not foods should he thoroughly cooked, the little grains g0 into the stomach as hard as grains of sand; thoroughly are not digested at all, but pass Out 0f the system without then most of them cooked furnishing any nourishment t0 the body: If starchy foods are fried in fats, as is the case with doughnuts, the granules of starch become coated with fat As the fat is not digested until it comes to the intestines; the saliva never reaches the coverings of the starch; and more work is thrown 0 the other juices of the body: The result is that the little glands which make these other juices are overworked, Or else the starch is not digested at all and therefore furnishes no nourishment to the body. When bread is sticky (we sometimes call it Soggy) in the middle of the loaf; it is because the flour has not been thoroughly cooked and the little grains Or granules You cannot feel these granules between your fingers, but of' starch are still hard. they are hard just the same; and very little of such food is made use of in the body: Remember that all starchy foods should be thoroughly cooked, and remember; too, that all vegetables are chiefly starchy in character: When fats are cooked over a very hot fire, an acid is developed that is injurious How fats should to the body This does not mean that when the fire is hot enough to broil a steak [35] be cooked well, it causes this acid to form; neither does it mean that heat sufficient to boil the grease for cooking doughnuts will cause it to form: Every cook knows that when she fiies fat meat over a fire that is too hot, it has a bitter taste.

The air that comes out of the lungs contains & very little oxygen and a great deal of carbon dioxid: The blood not only takes the oxygen out of the air; but gives carbon dioxid t0 the air: This carbon dioxid is very poisonous, and would kill the cells if it remained in the blood; hence we should never breathe the same air twice.

Thus, continued use of alcohol causes a smaller supply of gastric juice; and the food passes from the stomach into having been acted upon by the gastric juice, as it should the intestines without The result is that the food decomposes in the intestines and a poison is have been_ This poison up by the that carry the food formed. vessels from the is taken intestines and kills a great many of the cells of the body: Alcohol does not burn holes in the stomach; but it destroys the usefulness of the stomach by its action On the cells that secrete the gastric juice: very little of it reaches the intestines.

CHAPTERXV DISEASE GERMS We have learned that the body is made up of cells; and that each cell is alive The cells in our bodies cannot live separately: There are, however; certain animals and plants that are each made Up of a single cell.

Knowing this, it seems unnecessary for anyone ever to How sickness due to germs can be be sick with disease that is caused by a germ. This is literally true, and the only {prevented reason that we have germ diseases is because we do not kill the germs that come from the sick people: Irving Fisher of Yale University has said, "It is entirely possible to Professor wipe out consumption within & single generation ' It may not actually be done s0 quiekly; but it is certain that the disease can finally be wiped out, though it may require many generations to accomplish it. Why; then; are germ diseases allowed t0 exist? Simply because $0 many people do not know the facts; and because many who do know will not take the trouble to they kill the germs, even when realize that some one else may get the disease as a result of their carelessness What do you think of a woman who said, "Ido not care if my neighbor's children do scarlet fever from us; she is nol a friend of mine_ gel A woman has been heard t0 make such & statement t0 a health officer: [t way"? any is just such people as this who spread disease.

You see an illustration of such a patient in Figure 60, who is under quarantine for scarlet fever; where the little girl, but who is feeling quite well, is giving a book to two of her friends. The book contains the germs that cause scarlet fever; and the boys are very likely to contract the disease by handling the book: If every case of diphtheria were quarantined, and the people obeyed the health Why officer; there would soon be no more diphtheria: But how does it happen that every some care5 of diphtheria very peculiar disease. quarantined?

It is estimated that smallpox before 60,000,000 people. the discovery of Up to the time when the Spaniards invaded Mexico, there had been no smallpox Faccination there: The Spaniards brought the disease with them; and historians tell us that out living in Mexico at that time, at least 6,000,000 died of the 12,000,000 people smallpox. At that time the disease was considered fatal throughout the world; from community people fled without stopping to bury when it broke out in a their dead; thing person not more or less disfigured by the marks the It was t0 see rre body: disease leaves on the face and To-day we find a very different condition. There are nOW fewer fatalities from smallpox than from almost any other communicable disease. During 1906 and only 169 deaths from smallpox were reported from all over the United States Washington: What has caused this marked falling off in to the Census Bureau at the fatality of the disease? During the time that smallpox was killing people, all the doctors were many trying t0 find something that would cure the disease Or that would prevent it: In the { Discovery of [132] vaccination an English physician; latter part of the eighteenth century Dr: Edward Jenner; smallpox as did people of other noticed that milkmaids did not have #5 much occupations: He also noticed cows with little sores on their udders that looked very much like the sores that come with smallpox. He therefore tried making 0n the ars of people sores just like those He did this by on the udders of' the cows. taking a little of the matter from the sores On the cows and putting it into the scratches on the people's arms. After these sores had healed, the people who had been thus treated did not have smallpox. This simple practice has caused one of most deadly most easily the diseases become one of the known to to man controlled Though it is well known that before the discovery of vaccination smallpox was Prevention of a fatal disease, there are still some persons who say that vaccination has done smallpor by nothing to reduce the mortality When you leam some of the facts, you can judge vaccination: for yourself whether or not vaccination does prevent smallpox. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71, the German soldiers were all (I) In the Franco- Smallpox broke vaccinated, and only a part of the French army was vaccinaled; Frussian War smallpox and out in the two armies. As a result; 6,000 of the French died from only 278 of the Germans.

But; YOu might ask; if vaccination prevents smallpox. how any cases among the German soldiers?

vaccinated in Gloucester; and by the first of August there case of not Was smallpox in the [135] cily: But what had happened in the meantime? There had been 1,979 cases of smallpox; very large amount of money had been expended in quarantining; hundreds of persons had been disfigured for life; and 439 lives had been lost And all this simply because the people did not believe in vaccination: Quarantining smallpox is a most expensive luxury; which may possibly retard the progress of this disease, but was never known to check an epidemic of it Every epidemic of smallpox during the last one hundred years has been checked by vaccination. There are certain diseases which YOu are not likely to have more than once; one attack protects against another: Why and how does oe attack of a certain disease Why some diseuses do not protect against another? When a person is taken sick with one of these diseases; return the cells of' his body immediately begin to make a substance called antitoxin: We learned something about antitoxin when we were studying diphtheria. In diseases one attack protects against like scarlet fever; measles and smallpox, in which body another; the antitoxin that is formed in the when you are sick stays there for & time, in some cases a5 long long as You live.

There are 206 bones (not ineluding the The (rumework "f ~long bones. short teeth) in the body: The bones of the body are divided into four classes the hody bones, flat bones, and irregular bones. shape; all bones are composed in the same way: Every bone has an Regardless of their Constructiun "f portion. The outer portion is a dense layer called compact bone: The ouler and an inner hones bone inner portion is more open, and is much weaker; this is called cancellated (from cancella, a sponge). In the smaller bones; the marTow; which is quite sofi, runs through the ong spongy bone; in the larger bones; the marrow is distinct and is enclosed by the spongy bone. Every bone is covered by a thick; tough layer: the periosteum, which has three uses When the bone is injured by disease or accident, the periosteum makes new bone to fill in:The periosteum= long the break. It also builds new bone on the surface of the old a5 as the body is and repair growing: Finally the periosteum gives strong and firm attachment to the muscles, which send tendons into it. Every bone in the body (except the hyoid bone; to which the tongue is attached) is joined with some other bone. Most of them join with two Or more bones. In most instances the end!oints: of a bone which joins with another is rounded off and made very smooth; s0 that it can slide Thcy easily over the other bone: There are three principal kinds of joints in the body are called the ball and socket joint, the hinge joint, and the serrated or saw-tooth joint, [164] hltps Ilwww-gutenberg arglliles/53974/53974-h/53974-h.htm?utm_source-chatgplcom 100/123

THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM The digestive system is the part of our bodies in which the food we eat is S0 changed that The alimentary it can be made use of by the little cells in the body: It is composed of a long canal with 'canal many parts and enlargements, each part necessary for a certain required work. This canal as whole is called the alimentary canal. The mouth does the first part of the work for the digestive system: Here We find the teeth; Teeth which are used for grinding the food. The teeth are composed of three parts. the head (or The head, or crown; is very hard.

Besides the little glands in the walls of the intestine there are many thousands of little Villi %n4!mphatics: finger-like projeetions standing up from the walls. These are called villi. Each villus has in it very small vessels. into which the food passes afier it has been digested. These vessels are of two sorts: blood vessels; which take Up the digested starch and proteid foods; and another sort known as lymphatics; which take up the fats. All the lymphatics combine into a single vessel which empties into the great vein at the base of the neck: Thus the fatty foods pass into the blood and are mingled with the Food materials taken up dlirectly by the blood vessels. https (lwww gutenberg orgliiles/53974/53974-h/53974-h.htm?utm_sourcezchatgplcom 105/123

CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD them arteries and veins. The There are two kinds of blood vessels in the body. We call Two kimcls of blond arteries serve t0 carry the blood from the heart t0 all parts 0f the body: and the veins serve t0 vessels carry the blood back t0 the heart: The heart is really a part of the blood vessels; hall of each being like the veins and half like the arteries. side The walls of the arteries are thicker than those of' the veins Two sets of arteries leave the ~veins; Arteries and heart; one from each side. The artery that starts fiom the right side of the heart goes to the lungs and carries very poor supply of oxygen and is full of blood, which has eoiS impurities. We call this the pulmonary artery: The artery that leaves the lefi side of the heart [172] goes to all parts of the body but the lungs and carries arterial blood, which has much more oxygen and is much more free from impurities. If we follow the blood as it circulates we will see how it reaches all parts ofthe body: The big artery that leaves the left side of the heart divides into smaller and smaller arteries until { Cupillaries; dividing until they keep there are branches going tO every part of the body: These branches are S0 small that we call them arterioles, and these little arterioles divide and become again s0 small that we call them capillaries. the arterioles and the capillaries, something is While the blood is passing through happening t0 it.

The blood goes straight from the heart t0 the lungs and there it is changed into arterial blood The change consists in taking oxygen from the air and giving off carbon dioxid to the Arterial blood air: From the lungs the blood goes through the capillaries into the veins; the small again capillaries in the lungs uniting to form the pulmonary veins. These veins finally unite into empties into the upper half of the lefi side of the heart, and from there the one vein that blood goes to the lower half of the same side: The blood has now reached its starting point and is ready to begin its journey again.

Now that the dependence of public health upon personal hygiene is recognized, personal habits and sanitary conditions frankly dealt with than ae more formerly: thing points of an assigned lesson occasionally: to have one Or twO It is an excellent writing: Any topic that the teacher may think advisable to treat in this manner answered in being may be discussed on paper at the beginning of the recitation, five or six minutes allowed for thal purpose. Even & whole chapter may be assigned t0 be studied with a view of answering in writing the questions at the end of the chapter The written test can then take the place of the usual oral recitation. This method is suggested to the teacher who hesitates t0 discuss orally certain plain but essential facts. Chapter 32 on the Spread and Prevention of Consumption can be treated with best results orally; if the pupils are first made to feel the great danger of consumption and t0 realize the wrought by that dread disease: The attitude of possibility of preventing the vast havoc teacher and pupils should be that while the discussion may be disagreeable. the disgusting habits referred t0 in the text are so commonly practised that unless their dangers are taught this disease can never be wiped out: [183] https (lwww gutenberg orgliiles/53974/53974-h/53974-h.htm?utm_sourcezchatgplcom 114/123
